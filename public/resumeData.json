The first introduced to me readings in philosophy which piqued my interest. I had always been curious but never delved in deeply. The exposure lead me to enroll in philosophy courses and deepen my love for reading and contemplation. Learning about agile in the Software Engineering course gave me a big picture view of the development process. I came to understand the process as a system involving humans rather than purely algorithms and data structures. I am particularly interested in the human component of these systems."

The look and feel of the place immediately gave me an unforgettable experience. The clean, modern aesthetic. The neatly folded stacks and rows of clothing. The affordable prices. The minimalist styles that subtly stated their tastefulness. Such a place existed for my budget conscious yet fashion curious self. I had never been so enamored by another clothing store. While working at Uniqlo I strove to create an experience for customers that would rival my first impression. Starting with myself, then serving others, I came to understand the customer experience. I gained perspective on how to best meet their needs in alignment with store goals. To understand the customer and to create tailored solutions for them continues to be my goal."

As someone with a process oriented mindset, being in a task oriented environment gave me the tools to deliver results. Beyond basic self management skills like setting goals and time limits, I discovered how workplace systems could enable workers to focus on efficiency. I also realized homogenization of my labor would not develop my potential to its fullest, gaining further motivation to develop my own unique skills and knowledge."
